# Map and Table App

Prototype React app for using Esri ArcGIS SDK

## Map Container

Utilises Esri's ArcGIS SDK to display a map view with associated geospatial tooling. Will ideally use a geojson layer to display editable data, with attributes viewable from a table view.

### Create Map View Utility

Code that creates the map view.

## Catalog Table

Table view of geometry attributes.

## Heading Bar

Displays loaded geojson file name, buttons for controlling the view of the app, and the importing and exporting of geojson files.

## View Icon Buttons

Switch between full-screen map view or table view, or a split-screen of both.
